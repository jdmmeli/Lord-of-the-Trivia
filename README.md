## About

Lord of the Trivia is a quiz app that tests your knowledge of the Tolkien Legendarium. Starting off in Hobbiton, correct answers will take you further on your journey. At the end of the quiz, your final score will be tallied, determining how far you made it in your travels.

## Technologies Used

React.js
useState and UseContext are used to create a global state.
Css for styling. I tried to give the app a little bit of the ancient and magical feel of Tolkiens works through the styling.
